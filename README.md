# Tech-Layoffs-Data-Cleaning-SQL 

This SQL project focuses on cleaning a dataset of tech layoffs by following several key steps. First, a staging table is created to work with raw data without affecting the original. Duplicates are identified and removed using row numbers to filter out redundant records. Next, the data is standardized by trimming whitespace, consolidating industry names, and correcting inconsistent country and date formats. Null and blank values are handled by updating missing fields, especially in the industry column. Finally, unnecessary rows and columns are removed, and the cleaned data is prepared for further analysis.
